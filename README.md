# Anthony Dunphy Portfolio Website
This is a portfolio website build as part of my studying with UCD/Code Institute. The website showcases my work to date along with some sample photographs and videos of projects I have worked on. The aim was to create a miminalist site design which would aid readability and site loading speeds. The live version of the site can be found [here](https://anthonyfdunphy.github.io/portfolio-website/).

## Technologies

- **HTML**: Website structure was developed using the HTML language.
- **CSS**: Styling of the page was with CSS using an external stylesheet - linked to from the main HTML page.
- **Github**: Source code of the website is hosted on the my Github repo - push and commited sent to from Gitpod when developing the site.
- **Vimeo**: Video content was hosted on the Vimeo video platform and linked to in the website code.
- **Javascript**: Some javascript code has been implemented to allow for the user to click on the menu button on the mobile version of the site to toggle from the menu back to the last loaded webpage.

# UX Design

The aim of this website was to showcase previous project aswell as showcasing my HTML, CSS & JavaScript skillset. The site design is comprised of a sidebar and content section which remains constant between all webpages. A CSS grid was implemented which was made responsive through the use of media queries for each device screen. The design of the website was made playful with the addition of hover effects on links as well as underline animations on hover for the 'more' header and the 'info' header.

#### Example of some of the hover effects

## Testing

#### HTML Validator results
One of the main warning I recieved when submitting my HTML code for validation was the warning that there was no h2-h6 element in the section element as shown here:

As a result, I changed these section tags to div elements and it cleared all warnings or errors. Below is a screenshot of the index page, all other pages passed with no errors or warnings.
